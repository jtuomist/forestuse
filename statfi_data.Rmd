This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Data was downloaded (by hand, API was not found) from [VMI laskentapalvelu](https://vmilapa.luke.fi/#/compute) (Valtakunnallinen mets√§inventaari), and the data was from years 2009-2013. Parameters for the data download: forest area, tree volume, and tree number were searchded for 20-year age groups, areas categorised by the main tree species, seach including both forests and kitumaa (poorly growing areas), and using district levels.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(OpasnetUtils)
library(quiltr)

# qinstall("jtuomsto/luketest") # This is needed if you have not downloaded anything from this package before
dat <- qload("jtuomsto/luketest", "forests")

ggplot(dat[dat$Variable=="Tilavuus" , ], aes(x=Ikaluokka, weight=Tulos, fill=Maakunta))+geom_bar()+
  facet_grid(.~Alue)
```

```{r}

tmp <- dat[dat$Variable=="Tilavuus",]
tmp <- aggregate(tmp["Tulos"], tmp[c("Alue","Ikaluokka")], sum)
pl <- tmp %>%
#  group_by(Alue) %>%
  plot_ly(x=~Ikaluokka, y=~Tulos/1000, color=~Alue, type="bar") %>%
  layout(
#    barmode="group",
    yaxis=list(title="Puuston tilavuus (M m3)")
  )
pl
# pushIndicatorGraph(pl, 124) # Does not work due to an unknown error

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
